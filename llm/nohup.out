Response Okay, let's gather some information to build a hedging strategy for your crypto investments.

1) What is your goal with hedging? Is it to protect against downside risk, generate extra income, or something else? 



Questioning phase



Response Got it, protecting against downside risk is the main goal. A few more questions:

2) What crypto assets do you currently hold or want to hedge?

3) How much capital are you looking to allocate towards hedging?

4) What is your risk tolerance level? Are you okay with capping your upside potential in exchange for downside protection?

5) Do you want to hedge using options strategies (buying puts), futures contracts, or something else?

Please provide answers to these questions, and feel free to add any other relevant details. The more information I have, the better I can tailor the hedging strategy for you.

Response Okay, based on the information provided:

Parameters:
```
- Asset: Bitcoin (BTC)  
- Hedging Capital: $100,000
- Risk Tolerance: Medium (willing to cap upside for downside protection)
- Preferred Hedging Method: Options strategies (buying protective puts)
```

Potential Automation Logic:
```
1. Monitor BTC price movements 
2. When BTC price drops below a predetermined level (e.g. 20% from purchase price), automatically purchase BTC put options as a hedge
3. Put options strike price set slightly below current BTC price
4. Option expiration date set 3-6 months out 
5. Allocate 10-20% of $100k towards put option premiums
6. If BTC continues dropping, put options increase in value, offsetting unrealized losses
7. If BTC rebounds, let put options expire worthless, capping upside but protecting downside
```

The logic aims to provide downside protection on your BTC holdings using put options, while still allowing some upside participation if BTC recovers. The put option strike prices, expiration dates, and capital allocation can be adjusted based on your specific risk profile.

Response ```
- Asset: Bitcoin (BTC)  
- Hedging Capital: $200,000
- Risk Tolerance: Very High (willing to maximize upside potential)
- Preferred Hedging Method: Options strategies (selling cash-secured puts)
```

Potential Automation Logic:
```
1. Monitor BTC price movements
2. When BTC price drops, sell BTC cash-secured puts with strike below current price 
3. Set put strike e.g. 20% below current BTC price
4. Set put expiration 2-4 weeks out  
5. Collect premium from selling the cash-secured puts
6. If BTC continues dropping past strike, get assigned and buy BTC at discount
7. If BTC rallies, keep premium as income  
```

This strategy aims to capitalize on BTC's high volatility by selling cash-secured puts to collect premiums. With a very high risk tolerance, the strikes are set aggressively below market to maximize potential upside if assigned BTC at a discount.

Of course, unlimited downside risk exists if BTC crashes below the strike prices before expiration.

Response ```
- Asset: Solana (SOL)
- Hedging Capital: $100,000  
- Risk Tolerance: Medium
- Preferred Hedging Method: Options strategies (selling cash-secured puts)
```

Potential Automation Logic: 
```
1. Monitor SOL price movements
2. When SOL price drops, sell SOL cash-secured puts with strike 5-10% below current price
3. Set put expiration 4-8 weeks out
4. Collect premium from selling the cash-secured puts  
5. If SOL continues dropping past strike, get assigned and buy SOL at discount
6. If SOL rallies, keep premium as income
```

This adjusted strategy takes a more moderate approach by setting put strike prices 5-10% below market and longer 4-8 week expirations. It aims to provide downside protection while still collecting premiums if SOL remains range-bound or rises.

The lower strikes and longer expirations reduce premium income potential compared to the very high risk strategy, but also limit downside risk if SOL crashes hard.

  // Implementation for selling put option on Solana DeFi platform
  return 1000; // Example premium value

// Run the script
run();
```

This Novascript implementation includes the following functionality:

1. Import required libraries for interacting with Solana and Pyth oracle.
2. Define global constants like token mint addresses, hedging capital, risk tolerance, and preferred method.
3. Initialize connection to the Solana mainnet.
4. Fetch the current SOL price from the Pyth oracle.
5. Calculate the put strike price based on the risk tolerance (5-10% below current price for medium risk).
6. Calculate the put expiration date based on the risk tolerance (4 weeks for medium risk).
7. Execute the main logic to sell a cash-secured put option with the calculated strike price and expiration date.
8. Log the details of the sold put option, including strike price, expiration date, and collected premium.

Note: The `sellCashSecuredPut` function is a placeholder and needs to be implemented to interact with a specific Solana DeFi platform for executing the put option sale.

```bash
# Compile Novascript to bytecode

Questioning phase

Great, dollar cost averaging (DCA) is a simple and effective strategy for long-term investing. To set up your DCA strategy, I'll need some more information.

1. What is your preferred deposit amount for each DCA purchase?
False

Generation phase

```
Parameters:
- Asset to buy: SOL
- Dollar amount per purchase: $100 
- Purchase frequency: Weekly
- Exchange: Coinbase Pro

Automation Logic:
1. Every Monday at 9:00 AM PST:
   a) Get the current SOL/USD price from Coinbase Pro API
   b) Calculate the amount of SOL to purchase based on the $100 budget
   c) Place a market buy order for the calculated amount of SOL
2. If the purchase is successful, log the transaction details (timestamp, amount purchased, price)
3. If the purchase fails due to insufficient funds or API error, send an email notification
4. Keep a running total of the SOL acquired and the total amount invested
5. Generate a monthly report of all transactions and send it via email
```

Please confirm if you would like to proceed with generating the Novascript based on these parameters and automation logic.

To compile, deploy, and create an SPL token with properties:

```bash
# Compile the Novascript
novac dca_script.nova

# Deploy the compiled script to Solana
nova deploy dca_script.nvc --network mainnet-beta

# Create a new SPL token
spl-token create-token --decimals 9 --name "DCA Token" --symbol DCA

# Set token properties (assumes token address is stored in $TOKEN_ADDRESS)
spl-token set-property $TOKEN_ADDRESS --owner $OWNER_ADDRESS --property "strategy" --value "Dollar Cost Averaging SOL on Coinbase Pro"
